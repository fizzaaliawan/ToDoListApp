# ToDoListApp


A simple **command-line To-Do List application** built in Python.  
It allows you to **add, view, delete, and mark tasks as done**, with data persistence using a text file (`tasks.txt`).

## 🚀 Features
- 📌 **Add Tasks** → Add new tasks with optional deadlines  
- 📋 **Show Tasks** → View all tasks in a tabular format  
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks** → Remove tasks by selecting their number  
- ✔ **Mark as Done** → Update the status of tasks to "Done"  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** → Tasks are saved in `tasks.txt`

Do you also want me to make a **Windows EXE version** of this To-Do app (so you can run it without Python)?
